The Mechanical Engineering curriculum includes various hands-on skill courses such as Industrial Measurement & Instrumentation Computer-Aided Product Design, Mechanical Simulation, Object Oriented Programming, etc. It provides opportunities for students to acquire interdisciplinary skills and knowledge through various Choice-Based Curriculum System courses (CBCS). Mechanical students can complete the specialisation in Computer-Aided Engineering, Robotics & Automation, and Automobile Engineering. Many industry experts from various renowned industries deliver the skill courses to give practical flavor to learning. Students actively file the patent, start their ventures, and present technical papers at the international conference during their academics. Our diversified portfolio of syllabus and training has empowered our students to explore various opportunities in a broad spectrum of industries. Many IT industries also have CAD/CAM divisions, which increases the job potential of mechanical engineers. Students are placed in many core industries such as JSW, JCB India Ltd, SANY, Michelin, Tetra Pak, Forbes Marshal, Thermax, Capgemini (Engineering Div), Faurecia, Linde etc. With the growing needs of IT industries, students are also placed in various software industries such as L&T, KPIT, Infosys, ZS Associates, Neilsoft, Cognizant, Accenture, Deloitte etc.
